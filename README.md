# Weather_API
This repo have the purpose to design and build an Flask API using a caching system called redis. With the finally purpose to learn how to implement redis in API

In this project, instead of relying on our own weather data, we will build a weather API that fetches and returns weather data from a 3rd party API. This project will help you understand how to work with 3rd party APIs, caching, and environment variables.
